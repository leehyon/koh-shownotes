Are you the sort of person who works really hard, hits your deadlines, runs successful projects, wins over clients, but never seems to get noticed for all that diligence, much less promoted? Do you see other colleagues who put in less time getting more recognition and accolades than you? It can be extremely frustrating to feel overlooked at work, but it's often hard to know what to do about it, especially when you're not naturally self promotional, whether that's because of your personality, upbringing, culture, or previous work experiences in organizations that reward people who constantly speak up, stand out, take a lot of airtime. How do you make your mark while staying true to yourself? Today's guest has struggled with this problem herself and now advises other people on how to overcome it. Jessica Chen is a former TV news reporter, the founder of soulcast Media, a communications consultancy, an author of Smart Not Loud, How to get noticed at work for all the right reasons. She's going to talk to us today about how people accustomed to quiet cultures can operate in loud ones and finally get notice for their hard work and achievements. Jessica, welcome. 
你是那种非常努力工作、按时完成项目、成功赢得客户、但似乎从未因勤奋而受到关注、更不用说晋升的人吗？你是否看到其他比你投入更少时间获得更多认可和赞誉的同事？在工作中感到被忽视可能会令人非常沮丧，但通常很难知道该怎么做，尤其是当你不是天生的自我推销时，无论是因为你的个性、成长背景、文化，还是以前在奖励经常发言的人的组织中的工作经验。站出来，占用大量的通话时间。你如何在保持真实的自己的同时留下自己的印记？今天的客人自己一直在为这个问题而挣扎，现在建议其他人如何克服它。杰西卡·陈 (Jessica Chen) 曾是电视新闻记者，是通讯咨询公司soulcast Media的创始人，也是《聪明不大声》一书的作者，如何在工作中出于所有正确的原因而受到关注。今天她将与我们谈论习惯于安静文化的人如何在嘈杂的文化中运作，并最终因他们的辛勤工作和成就而受到关注。杰西卡，欢迎。

Hi, thank you for having me. 
嗨，谢谢你让我来。

发言人1   01:34
Let's start with this term, quiet culture. What defines a quiet culture and how does it differ from a loud one? 
让我们从安静文化这个术语开始。什么定义了安静文化，它与大声的文化有何不同？

发言人2   01:41
We know that when folks start working, it doesn't take long for them to realize, wow, it's a lot of the more extroverted, assertive, outspoken people who get noticed for all their achievements. Now, for me, this was something that wasn't easy to do. 
我们知道，当人们开始工作时，很快他们就会意识到，哇，很多更加外向、自信、直言不讳的人因为他们所有的成就而受到关注。现在对我来说，这是一件不容易做到的事情。

发言人2   02:01
And initially when I first started working, which at the time was as a broadcast journalist, I attributed to me being more introverted. But the more I thought about this, the more I realized a lot of this had to do with more than just personality alone. And I reflected back how the way I was raised. And I grew up in a very conservative and traditional family. I was taught to embody principles like humility, modesty, not seeking the spotlight, making sure I listen more than I speak, and overall trying to avoid conflict, to maintain a harmonious environment. So I call these quiet culture traits. 
最初当我刚开始工作时，当时我是一名广播记者，我认为这是因为我更加内向。但是，我越思考这个问题，就越意识到这与不仅仅是个性有关。我回想起我是如何成长的。我成长在一个非常保守的传统家庭中。我被教导要体现一些原则，如谦卑、谦虚、不寻求聚光灯、确保多听多说，总体上避免冲突、保持和谐的环境。所以我称这些为安静的文化特征。

发言人2   02:42
And there's so much power in quiet culture traits. It's just that when you work and when you start working, especially in a fast pace, perhaps a corporate environment, you start to see it's the people who know how to embody what I call loud culture traits. And they can do it very well. They're the ones I get noticed. So this really essentially started this, you know, multiyear long journey of how do I find that balance? 
安静的文化特质有着如此强大的力量。只是当你工作并开始工作时，特别是在快节奏中，也许是在企业环境中，你开始看到是那些知道如何体现我所谓的大声文化特征的人。他们可以做得很好。他们是我注意到的人。所以这基本上开始了这个漫长的旅程，我如何找到那种平衡？

发言人1   03:08
So your Taiwanese brought up in a Taiwanese immigrant family in the United States. Do you see lots of overlap with national or ethnic cultures in terms of the difference between quiet and loud? 
所以你的台湾人在美国的一个台湾移民家庭中长大。你认为在安静和喧闹之间的区别方面，有很多民族或族裔文化的重叠吗？

发言人2   03:20
Initially, yeah, I would have these conversations with my friends, a lot of whom are Asian American as well, and they also felt very similar, like, yeah, you know, in Asian culture specifically, you know, these are the principles that our parents raised us with. And then I started thinking about, well, I wonder if it really is an ethnic culture. And so I started talking to people beyond just those who grew up in an Asian culture, and some families just tend to be on the quieter side, but not even just from an, you know, audio perspective, right? There are some families who expect and teach their kids, this is how we want you to be. This is how we want you to behave. And if you think about how you were raised and how that has affected you and how you now show up in the workplace, I really think it is a part of who we are today. 
最初，我会和我的朋友进行这些对话，他们中的很多人也是亚裔美国人，他们也感觉非常相似，比如，是的，你知道，在亚洲文化中，特别是这些原则是我们的父母养育我们的原则。然后我开始思考，好吧，我想知道这是否真的是一种种族文化。所以我开始与不仅仅是在亚洲文化中长大的人交谈，一些家庭往往更安静，但不仅仅是从音频的角度，对吧？有一些家庭期望并教育他们的孩子，这就是我们想要的。这就是我们希望你的行为方式。如果你想想你是如何成长起来的，这对你产生了什么影响，以及你现在在工作场所的表现，我真的认为这是我们今天的一部分。

发言人1   04:07
You seem to suggest that most workplaces are loud cultures where quiet culture behavior really won't get you noticed no matter how hard you work. Why is that, and is it a Western culture phenomenon or do you think that it sort of might be more of a global 1? 
你似乎认为大多数工作场所都是嘈杂的文化，在那里，无论你多么努力，安静的文化行为都不会让你被注意到。这是为什么，这是一种西方文化现象，还是你认为它可能更像是一种全球性的现象？

发言人2   04:23
I think this is especially the case in many Western workplaces, but also workplaces that are multinational. 
我认为在许多西方的工作场所尤其如此，而且在跨国公司的工作场所也是如此。

发言人2   04:31
You know, there's such a thing called the Babel hypothesis, where people who tend to speak up more are perceived as having more leadership abilities, whether or not the quality of their speaking is that good. And so when you think about things like that, where people are rewarded of being the first one to speak or, you know, saying the most, taking up the most air time for example, in a meeting, then you start to see like, wow, there is a lot of emphasis on those who can communicate well. But I think for a large group of us, the ability to be the first one to speak, to chime in seamlessly in meetings, it's not so easy. And it's not that we don't want to, right? And it's not that we don't have great ideas. It's just that maybe we were raised to think a little bit more thoughtfully and deeply before we chime in, right? 
你知道，有一种叫做巴贝尔假说的东西，倾向于多说话的人被认为具有更多的领导能力，无论他们的讲话质量是否很好。所以当你想到这样的事情时，人们会因为成为第一个发言的人而受到奖励，或者你知道，说得最多，占用最多的时间，例如在会议中，然后你开始看到，哇，很多人强调那些能够良好沟通的人。但我认为对于我们中的一大群人来说，成为第一个发言的人，在会议中无缝地插话，并不是那么容易。并不是我们不想这样做，对吗？这并不是说我们没有伟大的想法。只是也许我们被教育成在插话之前要思考得更深思熟虑，更深入，对吧？

发言人2   05:24
And again, I think this does go beyond just being an introvert or extrovert. It's things like, you know, questioning, should I say that? Or, you know, maybe people already know this or, oh, you know, I am doing good work, but I certainly don't want people to feel like I'm boasting, right? So I think sometimes it's this narrative of, you know, these beliefs and these behaviors that are very much a part of us, but they don't necessarily translate or allow us to showcase ourselves in the best way. 
而且，我认为这确实超越了仅仅作为一个内向或外向的人。比如，你知道的，质疑，我应该这么说吗？或者，你知道，也许人们已经知道了，或者，哦，你知道，我做得很好，但我当然不希望人们觉得我在吹嘘，对吧？所以我认为有时候正是这些信仰和行为的叙述，这些信仰和行为是我们的一部分，但它们并不一定能够转化或让我们以最好的方式展示自己。

发言人2   05:53
The idea is it's not if you're quiet to be loud or if you're allowed to be quiet. It's really how can you find that? Call it that cultural balance? 
这个想法是，如果你安静，就不能大声说话，或者如果你被允许安静。你真的是怎么找到的？称之为文化平衡？

发言人1   06:02
Yeah, because you make the point that there are advantages to this quiet culture perspective. So what are some of those that we need to make sure we keep . 
是的，因为你指出了这种安静的文化视角有优势。那么，哪些是我们需要确保我们遵守的呢？

发言人2   06:11
So the attributes are things like being humble, being modest, you know, trying to take a thoughtful approach before speaking up, considering context, for example, right? I find that people who were raised in a quiet culture, you know, they like to observe the environment and just make sure that they have all the information before they share or contribute their thoughts. And I feel like that can also foster better workplace communications. And also, at the end of the day, you know, if you think about it, you know, the person who is obnoxiously, oh, look at me, look at how amazing I am. Nobody really likes that, right? So for my pie culture folks, of course, it's not about not talking and not sharing your thoughts, but it's like, how can you do it still embody these traits, but still be able to showcase how amazing you are and the impact you can make? 
所以特质是谦虚，谦虚，你知道，在说话之前尝试采取深思熟虑的方法，考虑背景，例如，对吗？我发现那些在安静的文化中长大的人，你知道，他们喜欢观察环境，并确保在分享或贡献他们的想法之前拥有所有信息。我觉得这也可以促进更好的工作场所沟通。而且，在一天结束时，你知道，如果你想一想，你知道，那个令人讨厌的人，哦，看看我，看看我有多了不起。没有人真正喜欢它，对吧？所以对于我的馅饼文化的朋友们，当然，这不是不说话，不分享你的想法，而是，你如何做到仍然体现这些特质，但仍然能够展示你有多棒，以及你可以产生的影响？

发言人1   07:03
Okay, so what are some of the key behaviors that quiet culture people need to focus on and get better at or shift in some way? 
好的，那么安静文化的人需要关注哪些关键行为，并在某些方面变得更好或转变？

发言人2   07:11
So there's 4 reframes in the book. The first reframe is what I call the category of how you engage with other people. And this is essentially your communication skills. And so for my quiet culture people, you know, you tend to want to default to listening more than speaking, but it's not about speaking or listening. And this is what I would encourage. Everybody is thinking about this. When you do speak, who are you speaking with and what do they care about? So it's less about should I speak or should I not speak? It's more about when I speak, this is who I'm talking to and this is how I would want to formulate my communications. 
所以书中有四个重构。第一个重新框架是我所说的你如何与其他人互动的类别。这基本上是你的沟通技巧。因此，对于我的安静文化的人来说，你知道，你往往想要默认地听而不是说，但这不是关于说或听。这就是我所鼓励的。每个人都在思考这个问题。当你说话时，你在和谁说话，他们关心什么？所以它不是关于我应该说话还是不说话？这更多的是关于当我说话的时候，这是我在和谁说话，这是我想要如何制定我的沟通方式。

发言人2   07:53
So it resonates because sometimes that narrative of should I or should and I can stop us, I remember I had a client once, and she was working in the finance industry and private equity specifically. 
所以它引起了共鸣，因为有时那种叙述应该我或者我可以阻止我们，我记得我曾经有一个客户，她在金融行业和私募股权工作。

发言人2   08:05
And I remember when she came to me, she was feeling extremely frustrated. You know, she was saying how she was surrounded by a lot of what she called very type a assertive, aggressive people on her team, and she really struggled with communicating. And so she was telling me how in her mind, she was like, well, even though I grew up in a quiet culture, maybe I just need to be louder. Maybe I just need to be the first one to speak of, be the loudest one in the room. But she says she felt so uncomfortable doing that. And she felt like when she did speak, you know, the reaction was always like, oh, wow, it just people were like surprised by the way she spoke, like it didn't seem very natural for her either. By the time she came to me, she felt she was just like, oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do. 
我记得她来找我的时候，她感到非常沮丧。你知道，她在说她的团队中被很多她称之为非常自信、好斗的人包围着，她真的很难沟通。所以她告诉我，在她的脑海中，她是怎么想的，尽管我在一个安静的文化中长大，也许我只需要大声一点。也许我只需要成为第一个说话的人，成为房间里声音最大的人。但她说她觉得这样做很不舒服。她觉得当她说话的时候，人们的反应总是像，哇，只是人们对她说话的方式感到惊讶，好像对她来说也不太自然。当她来找我的时候，她觉得她就像，哦，天哪，我不知道该怎么办。

发言人2   08:54
Like, I feel like I'm doing everything, you know, quiet isn't working, being louder isn't working. So what do I do? And one of the techniques we worked on is what I call the 4 a sequence. 
就像，我觉得我做了所有的事情，你知道，安静是不起作用的，大声是不起作用的。那我该怎么办？我们研究的技术之一是我称之为4 a序列的技术。

发言人2   09:06
The first thing you want to think about is acknowledging, acknowledging the person who just spoke before you, and acknowledging can be something as simple as that's a really interesting point, right? Saying something like that, or I hear what you're saying The next thing that you have to think about, and this is a word that I use, is you want to now anchor. So anchoring is where you repeat one or two words that person just said as a way to connect your thoughts to their thoughts. So it could sound like that's a really interesting point. And you mentioned the market South Asia, So they know what you have to say next, how that connects. And then that goes into the final one, which is now you give your answer like, what is it that you want to say? 
你首先要考虑的是承认，承认在你之前刚刚发言的人，承认可能是一个非常有趣的观点，对吧？说类似的话，或者我听到你说的话是你接下来要考虑的事情，我用这个词，你现在想要锚定。所以锚定是你重复那个人刚才说的一两个词，作为将你的想法和他们的想法联系起来的一种方式。所以这听起来像是一个非常有趣的观点。你提到了南亚市场，所以他们知道你接下来要说什么，以及它是如何联系的。然后进入最后一个，现在你给出你的答案，你想说什么？

发言人2   09:54
The strategy of acknowledging anchoring and then answering it really kind of changed her perspective of it's not about being quiet or loud, it's about knowing when to chime in. But not only that, how to do it in a way that reduces that communications friction. 
承认锚定，然后回答它的策略真的有点改变了她的看法，认为它不是关于安静或大声，而是关于知道什么时候该插嘴。但不仅如此，如何以减少通信摩擦的方式做到这一点。

发言人1   10:12
So let's walk through the second reframe, work style, right? How do you shift that? 
那么让我们来看看第二个框架，工作风格，对吧？你怎么改变它？

发言人2   10:18
Yes, so the second reframe is what I call spending time at work, because for many people who grew up in a quiet culture, and this is including myself, we think, okay, we're assigned to do this project. Let me do it, let me do it. Well, let me hit the deadline, and that's it. But what I find to be very strategic is how can you take the work that you have to do and leverage the projects you have to do for more opportunities it's thinking about, okay? I'm doing the work I'm doing it well. And now that I'm done with doing the work, how can I take this and maybe engage with other people and talk about it? 
是的，所以第二个重构就是我所说的花时间在工作上，因为对于许多在安静文化中长大的人来说，包括我自己，我们认为，好的，我们被分配去做这个项目。让我来做吧，让我来做吧。好吧，让我赶截止日期，就这样。但我发现非常具有战略性的是，你如何把你必须做的工作，并利用你必须做的项目来获得更多的机会，好吗？我正在做这份工作，我做得很好。现在我已经完成了工作，我怎么能接受这个，并与其他人交流并谈论它？

发言人2   10:57
I interviewed somebody for my book, and he shared an example that perfectly exemplifies this. So at the time, he was sitting in the risk department of his company, but he always had this itch to learn a little bit more about the business side of the organization. And so he was telling me that at the time, he was working on this project for the risk department that he was in. And once he was done, he took that completed project and then started engaging with folks on the sales team and said, hey, would you and the sales team be interested in using this as well? You know, we can run the numbers for you. We can analyze things. And it was a way to start opening conversations and eventually building relationships with those in a different department that he wanted to learn more about. 
我为我的书采访了某人，他分享了一个完美例证的例子。所以当时他坐在公司的风险部门，但他总是渴望更多地了解组织的业务方面。所以他告诉我，当时他正在为他所在的风险部门做这个项目。完成后，他接手了完成的项目，然后开始与销售团队的人接触，并说，嘿，你和销售团队也有兴趣使用这个吗？你知道，我们可以为您计算数字。我们可以分析事物。这是一种开始对话并最终与他想了解更多的不同部门的人建立关系的方式。

发言人1   11:45
So it's about sort of communicating the work that you've done to others in a way that will seem compelling to them. 
所以它是关于以一种对他人似乎有吸引力的方式向他们传达你所做的工作。

发言人2   11:52
Exactly, it's not just doing the work to do the work. It's thinking about the work that you have to do and how can you maximize the opportunity? 
确切地说，这不仅仅是为了工作而工作。它是思考你必须做的工作，以及如何最大限度地利用机会？

发言人1   12:01
Yeah, okay, third reframe. 
是的，好的，第三次重新框架。

发言人2   12:04
The third reframe is all about how do you handle wins? And essentially this means how do you celebrate the amazing work that you're doing? 
第三个重构是关于你如何处理胜利？这基本上意味着你如何庆祝你所做的惊人工作？

发言人2   12:13
Because for many of us who grew up in a quiet culture, the idea of seeking the spotlight is so unnatural. You know, we tend to say, well, if I'd doing good work, that should be enough, right? People will notice this. I mean, my manager knows I'm doing good work, that's enough, right? But the truth is, people are busy, our teams busy, our managers busy, they might recognize it, but. I think it's really important for us to also make sure other people keep it top of mind. And so the reframe is thinking about, okay, how can you talk about the benefit and the impact of your work so others can see the value of it? And you can even use language like, you know, this project that we just finished or that I worked on, on this part of it, it helped streamlined AB and C, or it helped, you know, improve the process of x, y, and z sometimes, you know, doing something as simple as that is all you need to do. 
因为对于我们许多在安静文化中长大的人来说，寻求聚光灯的想法是如此不自然。你知道，我们倾向于说，如果我做得很好，那就足够了，对吧？人们会注意到这一点。我的意思是，我的经理知道我做得很好，这就足够了，对吧？但事实是，人们很忙，我们的团队很忙，我们的经理很忙，他们可能会意识到这一点，但是。我认为确保其他人把这件事放在首位对我们来说非常重要。因此，重新框架是思考，好吧，你如何谈论你的工作的好处和影响，让其他人能够看到它的价值？你甚至可以使用语言，比如我们刚刚完成的项目或我参与的项目，在这一部分，它帮助简化了AB和C，或者帮助改进了x，y和z的处理过程，有时，你知道，你只需要做这么简单的事情。

发言人2   13:09
Another thing that I say, and when it comes to handling wins and celebrating the amazing work that you're doing is if a client emails you and just says, hey, you know, I, we really enjoyed, you know, working with you on this or somebody says, awesome job. If your manager, for example, is not on that email, simply forwarding it to them and just adding like, you know, your thoughts of really excited about this. 
我说的另一件事是，当涉及到处理胜利和庆祝你正在做的惊人工作时，如果客户给你发邮件，只是说，嘿，你知道，我们真的很享受，你知道，和你一起工作，或者有人说，好工作。例如，如果你的经理不在那封电子邮件上，只需将其转发给他们，并添加像这样的东西，你知道，你对此感到非常兴奋。

发言人1   13:32
Yeah, one of the tips I love from the book, which I practice myself is a yay folder in your email inbox, which helps you remember the things that you've done so you're ready to talk about them. 
是的，我很喜欢这本书中的一个提示，我自己也在实践，那就是在你的电子邮件收件箱里设置一个yay文件夹，它可以帮助你记住你做过的事情，这样你就可以谈论它们了。

发言人2   13:45
The yay folder is one of my favorite ones because it's just it's such a simple thing to do. And anybody, any of us can do it. You take a folder, you name it, a yay folder. I mean, of course you can name it like a happy folder, whatever you are. I called mine the yay folder. But essentially it's anytime somebody praises you or congratulates you or says awesome job, you know, any of those great positive words, you take that email and you drag it into your yay folder. And your yay folder effectively becomes the one centralized place. If you ever need evidence to show that you are doing good work. 
yay文件夹是我最喜欢的文件夹之一，因为它只是一件简单的事情。任何人，我们中的任何人都能做到。你拿一个文件夹，你可以命名它，一个yay文件夹。我的意思是，当然你可以把它命名为一个快乐的文件夹，无论你是什么。我把我的叫做yay文件夹。但本质上来说，每当有人赞美你、祝贺你或说好工作任何积极的话时，你就会接收那封电子邮件，并将其拖入你的yay文件夹中。你的yay文件夹有效地成为一个集中的地方。如果你需要证据证明你做得很好。

发言人1   14:20
Finally, the last reframe, which is around conflict. 
最后，最后的重构，围绕着冲突。

发言人2   14:24
Yes, it is how do you handle conflict? Now, for many of us, conflict is something that we, generally speaking, we want to avoid because it's uncomfortable and conflict can mean things like giving somebody feedback or tricky conversations can be even asking to pitch a project. 
是的，你是如何处理冲突的？现在，对于我们中的许多人来说，冲突是我们通常想要避免的事情，因为它不舒服，冲突可能意味着给某人反馈或棘手的对话，甚至可能是要求推销一个项目。

发言人2   14:43
For many of us, what we will first experience is that kind of fight or flight, right? It's like, oh my gosh, like, what do I actually do now For many of us in a quiet culture, I find because there's such an emphasis on maintaining a harmonious environment, we just default to solving the problem ourselves. 
对我们许多人来说，我们第一次经历的是那种战斗或逃跑，对吧？这就像，天哪，我现在对于很多处于安静文化中的人来说，我真的做些什么呢？我发现，因为我们非常强调保持一个和谐的环境，所以我们默认自己解决问题。

发言人2   15:02
Like, we don't want to bother people, we want to just kind of like figure things out. But what I have found is, and this is this definitely leverages my background as a journalist, people appreciate when you are proactive about communicating what is going on as it's happening, if you ever get the sense like, okay, you know, something's not going right or we're experiencing a problem, a client isn't happy, it's thinking, okay, wait a second, let me reframe this, what happened here? When did things go wrong? You know, who do I need to communicate to and it's not just who do I need to communicate to, it's how can I talk to them about what's going on? And oftentimes, when we are, for example, let's say, talking to our manager about this tricky situation, it's not about just brain dumping, like, oh my gosh, this is the problem. They're so unhappy, this is what went wrong, it's offering some solutions as well, and your solutions can be you even thinking in real time being like so, you know, as I'm thinking about this I'm thinking maybe we can consider this avenue or we can try to consider solving the problem like this. And it's not that you're saying that this is the solution, but at least you're giving the perception and the impression that you're thinking and you're problem solving and I have found that when we can approach conflict like this, it can make and also help bolster our credibility because we're not showing people we're we're shying or hiding in times of conflict. 
就像，我们不想打扰别人，我们只想把事情弄清楚。但我发现的是，这肯定利用了我作为记者的背景，当你积极主动地传达正在发生的事情时，人们会感激你，如果你得到这样的感知，好吧，你知道，有些事情不对劲，或者我们遇到了问题，客户不高兴，它在想，好吧，等一下，让我重新构建一下，这里发生了什么？什么时候出了问题？你知道，我需要和谁沟通，不仅仅是我需要和谁沟通，而是我如何与他们谈论正在发生的事情？很多时候，比如说，当我们和经理谈论这个棘手的情况时，这不仅仅是关于大脑倾倒，比如，天哪，这就是问题。他们太不开心了，这就是出了问题的地方，它也提供了一些解决方案，而你的解决方案甚至可以是你实时思考的样子，你知道的，当我在思考这个问题时，我在想，也许我们可以考虑这种途径，或者我们可以尝试像这样解决问题。并不是说这是解决方案，但至少你给人的感觉和印象是你在思考和解决问题，我发现当我们能够像这样处理冲突时，它可以产生并帮助提高我们的信誉，因为我们并没有向人们展示我们在冲突时期害羞或躲藏。

发言人1   16:32
You talk a lot about bias and how it can backfire when you start acting counter to people's expectations, whether that's because you've always behaved a certain way or because of your race or your gender, and then you talk about the internal bias or discomfort with change when you've been brought up to always act a certain way, and now you're trying to push yourself to act a little differently. So how do you get over that? 
你谈论了很多关于偏见的事情，以及当你开始违背人们的期望行事时，它会如何适得其反，无论这是因为你总是以某种方式行事，还是因为你的种族或性别。然后当你被教育成总是以某种方式行事时，你会谈论内在的偏见或对变化的不适，现在你正试图推动自己以不同的方式行事。那你是怎么克服的呢？

发言人2   16:59
I have this story in the book, and it's actually a story of my mom. So she was a homemaker for about 25 years, and she was at home. Stay at home mom, just taking care of my brother and I, but later on, around in college, I remember my parents, they got divorced and suddenly my mom had to go back to work. And if you can imagine, my mom, she's an immigrant, didn't really have much work experience. 
我在书里有这个故事，它实际上是我妈妈的故事。所以她做了大约25年的家庭主妇，而且她在家。呆在家里的妈妈，只照顾我和我的兄弟，但后来，在大学里，我记得我的父母，他们离婚了，突然我妈妈不得不回去工作。如果你能想象，我妈妈，她是一位移民，实际上并没有太多的工作经验。

发言人2   17:24
She eventually found a job as a sales associate for a cosmetic brand. And, you know, she was telling me how difficult it was for her to, you know, work in that environment because, you know, she didn't understand the workplace and cultural norms and she felt overshadowed a lot. She also felt like people took advantage of her as well. And after a while, she actually seemed to enjoy the work. And I remember asking her like, is work still difficult for you? Like, what changed? Like, you know, how are you doing, right? And I remember she had this mentality, and it really just stuck with me that in good times and in bad times, you have to be your own best cheerleader. 
她最终为一个化妆品品牌找到了一份销售助理的工作。而且，你知道，她告诉我在那种环境中工作对她来说有多么困难，因为，你知道，她不了解工作场所和文化规范，她感到被掩盖了很多。她也觉得人们也在利用她。过了一段时间，她似乎真的很喜欢这项工作。我记得我问她，工作对你来说仍然很难吗？比如，什么改变了？就像，你知道的，你好吗？我记得她有这种心态，我一直坚信，在好时光和坏时光，你都必须成为自己最好的啦啦队长。

发言人2   18:06
That's probably what, you know, helped build her resilience through those tough times of being a quiet culture person, working in a loud culture, competing with people to like sell as many, you know, products as they could. And eventually, and this is the best part of the story, she became the one of the highest grossing sales associate at the department store. 
这可能是什么，你知道，帮助她在艰难时期建立了韧性，作为一个安静的文化人，在一个嘈杂的文化中工作，与人们竞争，尽可能多地销售产品。最终，这是故事中最精彩的部分，她成为百货公司收入最高的销售助理之一。

发言人1   18:28
Yeah, I love the celery mushroom story about changing your self talk. 
是的，我喜欢关于改变自我对话的芹菜蘑菇故事。

Yes, the self talk is certainly one of those things where we form this narrative in our head or we start kind of going and MP into this negative mode of thinking. And one of the strategies that I have to help us, you know, kind of like get out of it is it's about labeling. And labeling is how you can essentially acknowledge the thoughts that are happening and evaluating whether they are helpful or unhelpful. 
是的，自我对话肯定是我们在脑海中形成这种叙述或开始走向这种消极思维模式的事情之一。而我必须帮助我们的策略之一，你知道，有点像摆脱它，就是关于标签。标签是你如何基本上承认正在发生的想法，并评估它们是否有用。

I was working with a client, and she was a kind of person who would dwell. And so this is when I said, when you notice that negative mental voice in your head, and that mental voice is telling you things like, oh my gosh, you're not good enough. Oh my gosh, your manager's so mad at you. It's labeling that mental talk a word. 
我和一个客户一起工作，她是一个会住的人。所以这就是当我说，当你注意到脑海里有消极的心理声音，而那个心理声音告诉你一些事情，比如，天哪，你不够好。我的天哪，你的经理很生你的气。这是给那个心理谈话贴上一个词的标签。

And for her, I asked her this question, what's your least favorite vegetable? And she was like, I don't know, celery. I'm not a huge fan of celery, and I was like, perfect, that is going to be what you're going to label the negative self talk. So when you see yourself going down the spiral of, oh my gosh, you know, this person doesn't like me or i'm doing a terrible job, you got to be able to catch yourself sometimes and say, okay, this is the celery talking. I acknowledge that, but let me pause and let me try to pivot. So then I asked her, what's your favorite vegetable? And she was like, mushrooms? And I was like, perfect. 
对于她，我问了她这个问题，你最不喜欢的蔬菜是什么？她就像，我不知道，芹菜。我不是一个芹菜的超级粉丝，我想，完美的，那将是你要给消极的自我对话贴上的标签。所以当你看到自己陷入这样的漩涡时，哦，天哪，你知道，这个人不喜欢我或者我的工作很糟糕，你有时候必须能够抓住自己，说，好吧，这是芹菜在说话。我承认这一点，但让我暂停一下，让我试着思考一下。于是我问她，你最喜欢的蔬菜是什么？她就像，蘑菇？我就像，完美。

发言人2   20:08
We will label your positive self talk mushrooms so that once you acknowledge the negative self talk, the celery talking, then you go, okay, wait. I'm going to put the celery aside and I'm going to bring up the mushroom. 
我们会给你的积极自我对话贴上 “蘑菇” 的标签，这样一旦你承认消极的自我对话，比如芹菜的谈话，然后你就会说，好的，等等。我要把芹菜放在一边，把蘑菇拿来。

After reframing, you recommend being really proactive in a couple areas of work. You talk about shaping your career brand around something that you're good at and you really love doing. You talk about building credibility. But I want to drill down on this idea of actually asking for and getting the assignments, the projects, the roles that you want. How do you make sure that that happens? 
在重新组织之后，你建议在几个工作领域真正积极主动。你谈论的是围绕你擅长且真正喜欢做的事情来塑造你的职业品牌。你谈论建立信誉。但是我想深入探讨一下这个想法，即实际询问并获得你想要的任务、项目和角色。你如何确保这种情况发生？

I think advocating for ourselves is one of the most important skills we need to learn. So I like to think about it in this like 4 part framework, which I call act AC, CT, yeah, so the first is the first a, and that is ask. In order to advocate for yourself, you've got to ask for what you want because you can't assume other people are going to know what you want. You eventually have to put yourself out there and ask. 
我认为为自己发声是我们需要学习的最重要的技能之一。所以我喜欢在这个四部分框架中思考它，我称之为交流行为，CT，是的，所以第一个是第一个a，那就是ask。为了为自己辩护，你必须问问你想要什么，因为你不能假设别人会知道你想要什么。你最终必须把自己放在那里并问。

发言人2   21:17
So that's the first A, the second one is the C, and that is circling back because oftentimes I have found we actually get what we want. We can close that deal when we circle back and follow up. But it's not just about saying, hey, following up here or hey, circling bad, just want to get your thoughts. It's thinking about when you do circle back, how can you be intentional? And what I mean by this is, can you offer a new piece of information when you circle back? Can you say, since our last conversation I've done a little bit more research and this is why I really think this is what we have to do . 
所以这是第一个A，第二个是C，并且它正在盘旋，因为通常我发现我们实际上得到了我们想要的。当我们回退并跟进时，我们可以完成这笔交易。但这不仅仅是说，嘿，跟着这里或者嘿，绕道而行，只是想了解你的想法。它在思考当你回头时，你怎么能故意呢？我的意思是，当你回头看的时候，你能提供一条新的信息吗？你可以说，自从我们上次谈话以来，我做了更多的研究，这就是为什么我真的认为这是我们必须做的。

so that you're not nagging or being seen as a pest, you're actually adding to the conversation. 
这样你就不会唠叨或被视为有害生物，你实际上是在增加对话。

发言人2   22:01
Exactly, and I think that's kind of like the missing link for a lot of people. It's like, how can you make the information feel fresh, make it feel new? The third one is the sea as well, and this one is celebrate and this is celebrate your wins. And it's similar and very familiar to one of the reframes. And it goes back to not just doing the work, to do the work, but it's taking the work that you're doing and ensuring other people know about it. And then finally, the T is turn down requests because at the end of the day, advocating for ourselves is also being able to say no, say no to certain things because the time that we have at work is limited. If we say yes to too many things, ultimately we're taking time away from things that we actually want to do or things that could really accelerate our career. 
确切地说，我认为这对很多人来说有点像缺失的环节。这就像，你如何让信息感觉新鲜，让它感觉新鲜？第三个也是海，这个是庆祝，这是庆祝你的胜利。它与其中一个重构结构相似且非常熟悉。它不仅仅是做工作，而是承担你正在做的工作，并确保其他人知道。最后，T是拒绝请求，因为在一天结束的时候，倡导自己也能够对某些事情说不，说不，因为我们在工作中的时间是有限的。如果我们对太多事情说是，最终我们会从我们真正想做的事情或可能真正加速我们职业生涯的事情中抽出时间。

And what would you want managers to better understand about employees who are quiet culture people and how to better engage them? 
你希望经理们更好地了解那些安静文化的员工，以及如何更好地吸引他们？

发言人2   22:59
I think it's going back to that quiet culture bias of not jumping to those conclusions of just because somebody is quiet on your team, it doesn't mean they don't care or thinking that because this person hasn't said anything, that they don't have their own ideas or their own contributions. 
我认为这是回到了那种安静的文化偏见，即不要仅仅因为你团队中有人很安静就得出这些结论，这并不意味着他们不关心或认为因为这个人什么也没说，他们没有自己的想法或贡献。

Sometimes as a good manager, it's creating that runway, for example, for them. And when I say runway, I mean things like, you know, when you're in 18 meeting, you can say, oh, hey, Jessica, I know you had mentioned to me about this idea you had last week. Would you want to share it with the team? And sometimes just creating that runway can start to get them comfortable in utilizing and using their voice, right? 
有时候作为一个优秀的管理者，关键是要为他们创造跑道。当我说 “跑道” 时，我的意思是，你知道，当你18岁的时候开会，你可以说，哦，嘿，杰西卡，我知道你上周向我提到了这个想法。你想与团队分享吗？有时候仅仅创造一条跑道就可以让他们舒适地利用和使用自己的声音，对吧？

发言人2   23:41
But it's also thinking about the multiple ways in how people communicate. You know, we know communications is not just all verbal, which is kind of what we always default to. So just also making sure we are as a manager, giving shout outs. So I think when we think about, you know, acknowledging folks on our team, it's not putting our attention to those who are always louder. It's making sure that we are giving equal coverage to everybody on the team. 
但它也在考虑人们沟通的多种方式。你知道，我们知道沟通不仅仅是口头的，这是我们总是默认的。所以也要确保我们是一个经理，大声喊叫。所以我认为，当我们考虑承认我们团队中的人时，并不是把我们的注意力放在那些总是大声的人身上。它确保我们对团队中的每个人都给予平等的覆盖。

Well, thank you Jessica, I learned a lot from your book, and I think the advice is really good as someone who sort of alternates between being a quiet and loud person, thanks so much for talking with me today. 
好的，谢谢Jessica，我从你的书中学到了很多，我认为这个建议对于一个在安静和大声之间交替的人来说真的很好，非常感谢今天与我交谈。
